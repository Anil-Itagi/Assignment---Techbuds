### User Management Application
This project is a simple user management application built using React for the **frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend**, and **MongoDB** for the database. The application allows users to perform basic **CRUD** operations, such as **adding, updating, and deleting** user records. Additionally, it supports a basic user interface for displaying user details and performing updates.

## Features
Display a list of users.
Allow adding new users.
Update existing user information (name, email, and message).
Delete users from the list.
Basic backend API for managing users.
Modal dialog for updating user information.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React, CSS (Custom Styles)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
API: RESTful API using Express
Other: Axios (for API calls), React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
Setup Instructions
## 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-management-app.git
## 2. To Start the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder and install the dependencies:

bash

cd frontend
npm install
npm start
This will start the React application on your local machine.

## 3. To Start the Backend
Navigate to the backend folder and install the dependencies:

bash

cd backend
npm install
Next, create a .env file in the backend directory with the following values:

bash

MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB URI>
PORT=5000
Replace <Your MongoDB URI> with your actual MongoDB URI, including the database name. You can obtain this URI from MongoDB Atlas or your local MongoDB setup.

Now, start the backend server:

bash

npm start
This will start the Node.js server on port 5000 by default, handling API requests for managing users.

File Structure
The project is organized into the following structure:

## Frontend:
components/: Contains all the React components that define the UI and functionality.
HomePage: The main page divided into three columns for user selection, user list, and additional content.
Navbar: The navigation bar with links to "Home", "All Users", "Create New User", and a "Service Test" to print a text in the console.
UserDetails: Displays the details of a selected user.
UserForm: A form for creating new users.
UserListIterator: Displays the list of all users.
## Backend:
routes/: Contains the routes for handling the API requests.
users.js: API route for managing users (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
models/: Contains the MongoDB models, including the User schema.
User.js: Defines the schema for the User document in MongoDB.
## Notes:
In the frontend, you will need to update the base URL for the API calls in the respective components (e.g., UserListIterate, UserForm, etc.) to match your backend URL.
The backend should be connected to a MongoDB database. Ensure that the MONGO_URI in the .env file is correct and points to your MongoDB instance.

## Example API Endpoints
Here are the endpoints you can use to interact with the user data:

GET /api/users: Fetch all users.
POST /api/users: Create a new user.
PUT /api/users/:id: Update an existing user's details (name, email, message).
DELETE /api/users/:id: Delete a user by their ID.

## Design and UI
The UI is designed using custom CSS (and optionally Bootstrap for layout). Below are some screenshots of the user interface:

Home Page: Divided into three columns:

First column: Selected user details.
Second column: List of all users.
Third column: Additional content.
Navbar: Contains links to the homepage, all users, create a new user, and a service test to print a message in the console.

User Details Page: Displays the details of a selected user.

User Form: A form to create new users with input fields for name, email, and message.

User List Iterator: Displays all the users in a list format with options to update or delete each user.
